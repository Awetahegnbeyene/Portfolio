## Projects
## Analyzing student grades in the Open University
- Our objective was to address the challenge of understanding and enhancing student performance at the Open University. To achieve this, we conducted comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory analysis, utilized Tableau for effective data visualization, and managed data through SQL Server. By doing so, we provided actionable insights that enabled the institution to offer targeted support, make informed decisions, and ultimately improve student outcomes.

  ## Coupling remote sensing and crop growth model to estimate national wheat yield in Ethiopia
The project was focused on enhancing wheat yield estimation in Ethiopia, a critical component of agricultural planning and food security efforts. Through the integration of remote sensing data, specifically MODIS time-series Leaf Area Index (LAI), I developed an innovative methodology utilizing the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to incorporate LAI into the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model. The results, validated against field-measured yields from the 2018 growing season, demonstrated a substantial improvement in accuracy, with an impressive R-squared value of 0.80 and an RMSE of 413 kg/ha. This project showcases the potential of Python-driven data analysis to revolutionize agricultural yield forecasting, providing actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in Ethiopia and similar regions.
